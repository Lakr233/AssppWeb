# AssppWeb

A web-based tool for acquiring and installing iOS apps outside the App Store. Authenticate with your Apple ID, search for apps, acquire licenses, and install IPAs directly to your device.

## Zero-Trust Architecture

AssppWeb uses a zero-trust design where the server **never sees your Apple credentials**. All Apple API communication happens directly in your browser via WebAssembly (libcurl.js with Mbed TLS 1.3). The server only acts as a blind TCP relay (Wisp protocol) and handles IPA compilation from public CDN downloads.

> **⚠️ Important Security Notice:** There are no official Asspp Web instances. Use any public instance at your own risk. While the backend cannot read your encrypted traffic, a malicious host could serve a modified frontend to capture your credentials before encryption. Therefore, **do not blindly trust public instances**. We strongly recommend self-hosting your own instance or using one provided by a trusted partner. Always verify the SSL certificate and ensure you are connecting to a secure, authentic endpoint.

## Quick Start

### Deploy to Cloudflare

[![Deploy to Cloudflare](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/Lakr233/AssppWeb&apiTokenTmpl=%5B%7B%22key%22%3A%22workers_scripts%22%2C%22type%22%3A%22write%22%7D%2C%7B%22key%22%3A%22containers%22%2C%22type%22%3A%22write%22%7D%2C%7B%22key%22%3A%22cloudchamber%22%2C%22type%22%3A%22write%22%7D%5D&apiTokenName=AssppWeb%20Deploy)

This uses Cloudflare Workers + Containers with the published image `ghcr.io/lakr233/assppweb:latest`.

Requirements:

- Cloudflare Workers **Paid** plan (Containers are not available on Free).
- Deploy/build token with:
  - `Workers Scripts Edit`
  - `Containers Edit`
  - `Cloudchamber Edit`

If your build log fails at `Deploy a container application` with `Unauthorized`, your build token is missing required Containers/Cloudchamber permissions.

### Deploy to Railway

<details>
<summary>Click to show Railway deployment instructions</summary>

1. Go to [railway.com/new/image](https://railway.com/new/image) → enter `ghcr.io/lakr233/assppweb:latest`
2. In service **Settings**, set **Healthcheck Path** to `/api/settings` and deploy
3. Right-click the service → **Attach volume** → mount path: `/data`
4. In **Variables**, set `DATA_DIR` = `/data` and deploy
5. In **Settings** → **Networking**, generate a public domain or add a custom domain

**Notes**

- The free trial works but has limitations (volume expiry, network restrictions). **Hobby** plan ($5/month) or above is recommended for reliable use.
- Enable [**Serverless**](https://docs.railway.com/deployments/serverless) in service settings to scale down to zero during idle periods
- Railway [auto-updates](https://docs.railway.com/deployments/image-auto-updates) `:latest` images from GHCR — new releases will be deployed automatically within a few hours

> **⚠️ Custom domain with Cloudflare:** Railway's Cloudflare integration creates DNS records with Proxy enabled (orange cloud) by default. After authorizing, go to Cloudflare DNS settings and switch the CNAME record to **DNS only** (gray cloud) — Railway handles TLS automatically. If you keep Cloudflare Proxy on, you must set SSL/TLS mode to **Full** (not Flexible or Full Strict), otherwise you'll get an infinite redirect loop. See [Railway docs](https://docs.railway.com/networking/troubleshooting/ssl#err_too_many_redirects).

### Self-Host with Docker Compose

**Setup Docker Compose**

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Lakr233/AssppWeb/main/compose.yml
docker compose up -d
```

**Environment Variables**

| Variable                                    | Default         | Description                                                                    |
| ------------------------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `PORT`                                      | `8080`          | Server listen port                                                             |
| `DATA_DIR`                                  | `./data`        | Directory for storing compiled IPAs                                            |
| `PUBLIC_BASE_URL`                           | _(auto-detect)_ | Public URL for generating install manifests (e.g. `https://asspp.example.com`) |
| `UNSAFE_DANGEROUSLY_DISABLE_HTTPS_REDIRECT` | `false`         | Disable HTTPS redirect (see warning below)                                     |

**Reverse Proxy (Required for Install Apps on iOS)**

iOS requires HTTPS for `itms-services://` install links. You must put AssppWeb behind a reverse proxy with a valid TLS certificate.

> **⚠️ Redirect loop (`ERR_TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS`)?** Some reverse proxies (e.g. NAS built-in proxies) always send `X-Forwarded-Proto: http` even when the client connected via HTTPS, causing an infinite redirect loop. If you cannot configure your proxy to send the correct header, set `UNSAFE_DANGEROUSLY_DISABLE_HTTPS_REDIRECT=true` as a last resort. **This disables the HTTP→HTTPS redirect — you must ensure your proxy enforces HTTPS externally.**

The following is an example Caddyfile configuration:

```
asspp.example.com { reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:8080 }
```

**⚠️ Make Sure WebSocket Works**

AssppWeb relies on the Wisp protocol over WebSocket (`/wisp/`) for its zero-trust architecture. Ensure your reverse proxy or CDN (e.g., Nginx, Cloudflare) is configured to allow WebSocket connections, otherwise the app will fail to communicate with Apple servers.

## Security Recommendations

**DDoS Protection**

IPA files can be hundreds of megabytes. If your instance is publicly accessible, put it behind a CDN like Cloudflare to absorb bandwidth and prevent abuse.
